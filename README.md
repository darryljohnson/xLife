# xLife Simulator
### A Brief Introduction
xLife Simulator is a fully interactive browser based Life editor currently based on John Horton Conway rules (listed below). xLife Simulator allows the control of the speed of the game, the worlds position, and allows you to create your own custom configurations. Future releases will support the custom configuration of rules, colors, and other styles.
### How To Use
xLife Simulator is entirely cursor controller. The interative toolbar in the top right will allow you to control the speed and design of the Life world. Clicking anywhere in the world will toggle the generation of a cell in the highlighted position.
### Customizing
xLife Simulator does not currently support the customization of the board size, color, or any other styling. More features to address this issue will be released in future updates.
### Browser Support
xLife Simulator works in modern browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer). xLife may not work in older versions of Internet Explorer.

In order for xLife to work with Internet Explorer, you must allow blocked content when you first load the page. Other browsers automatically support this content.
### Features
#### Interactive Toolbar
xLife Simulator now includes a cool interactive toolbar that can control the progress, speed, and structure of Life. Not only that, but it also lists some statistics about the current world.
#### Conway's Life Rules
xLife Simulator now supports the rules for Conway's Game of Life. The addition of other rule sets will come in future releases.
## Conway's Game of Life
### Introduction
The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

The "game" is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves or, for advanced players, by creating patterns with particular properties.
### Rules
The rules are quite simple. In fact there are only 4 of them (actually 3 if you combine rules 1 and 3).

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Based on these simple rules a fun and intersting game emerges. A game ruled by both static and dynamic patterns that span the entire world.
