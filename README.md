## xLife Simulator
### A Brief Introduction
xLife Simulator is a fully interactive browser based Life editor currently based on John Horton Conway rules (listed below). xLife Simulator allows the control of the speed of the game, the worlds position, and allows you to create your own custom configurations. Future releases will support the custom configuration of rules, colors, and other styles.
### How To Use
xLife Simulator is entirely cursor controller. The interative toolbar in the top right will allow you to control the speed and design of the Life world. Clicking anywhere in the world will toggle the generation of a cell in the highlighted position.
### Customizing
xLife Simulator does not currently support the customization of the board size, color, or any other styling. More features to address this issue will be released in future updates.
### Browser Support
xLife Simulator works in modern browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer). xLife may not work in older versions of Internet Explorer.

In order for xLife to work with Internet Explorer, you must allow blocked content when you first load the page. Other browsers automatically support this content.
