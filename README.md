## A Brief Introduction
xLife Simulator is a fully interactive browser based Life editor currently based on John Horton Conway rules (listed below). xLife Simulator allows the control of the speed of the game, the worlds position, and allows you to create your own custom configurations. Future releases will support the custom configuration of rules, colors, and other styles.
